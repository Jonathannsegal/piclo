          <p className="text-lg mb-6">
            For any dispute you have with Piclo, you agree to first contact us at contact@piclo.app and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. If Piclo has not been able to resolve the dispute with you informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. Unless you and Piclo agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where Piclo's U.S. headquarters are located. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, except that Piclo will pay for your reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to the Service. All claims must be brought in the parties' individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, and, unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims. you agree that, by entering into these terms, you and piclo are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
